# odin-landing-page
This is my Landing Page Project
I will use skills like style.css editing, flexbox, and other basics to set up a website
My first attempt at making a legit website
I want it to look good and be functional 
I want to play with fonts and colours
I want to improve overall coding knowledge and language
